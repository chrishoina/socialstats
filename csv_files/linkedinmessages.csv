Hope everything is fine at your end.   Sharing some details about Tealfeed. Tealfeed was launched last year and we are building Tealfeed with a vision to help people discover & follow creators who can add value through creating insightful content.  Till the time we introduce monetization and start connecting creators with brands for paid projects (around July-August this year), we plan on providing more visibility to the profile of our creators and working on the distribution of their content. We also plan on providing early access to creator tools to our earliest creators (like analytics) in the coming months.  For the next few months, we don't expect our creators to create exclusive content for us, we only want them to start building an active portfolio on Tealfeed (till the time we introduce monetization). In the coming months, we would be sharing details regarding monetization (would be introducing it initially with our earliest creators).  The platform link is: www.tealfeed.com  Would you be interested in collaborating with us as a creator? Also, if there's anything specific you would like to know, please do let me know.

If you want to work with Cloud, Data and microservices, this is a strong company to work for.   OneMain has a strong technology presence in Baltimore and Chicago. I actually worked with them in Chicago for 5 years and help bring on 20-25 engineers over the last 5 years. Now, OneMain is looking to build out their team in the Charlotte and surrounding area to saccharate the Carolina technical talent market.   OneMain just asked me to bring on 5-6 important hires to work remotely but be in the Charlotte market so they can keep the circle of engineers growing in their Charlotte based office.   Here are their current priority roles: -	Implementation Engineer: strong knowledge of IBM tech and ability to lead out a project and grow a team -	Digital Technology Manager: lead out teams to scale microservice projects. Any previous Unix/Linux and SaaS is excellent  -	Lead/Senior Backend or Full stack engineer: Rails oriented but they bring on strong programmers -	Cloud Network Architect: Cisco Cloud engineer   These roles range from 120K-175K depending on your experience. They have always been open to negotiation for people looking for salaries outside of that range.   Are you looking for new roles at this time? Happy to get a casual intro call set so you can learn more. I would also love any friends who may be looking. These are a few roles we actively work but we have 10-15 other companies we are working with that offer remote technology roles opportunity.  Can we connect to discuss?

I mainly left to get into a larger company and shield my family from the economic uncertainty abounding back in June. I now oversee the creation and management of virtual inventory and decentralized access systems for clinical trial patients. And while I'm fairly comfortable where I'm at and it pays well - I am bored out of my mind as I'm pretty efficient and there is just not much else to do, or take on, or experiment with.  ¬† I will definitely reach out to Kate to see if she has a pulse on the CCS hiring timeline. Also, If anything comes up in your ""neck of the IBM woods"" that seems fun and challenging but does not require expert programming skills (I can google and python/R/SAS some lol), feel free to shoot me a note.",INBOX

I don't know much about Watson. ¬†But what I do know is that the Watson ""gamble"" has yet to show its value. ¬†I do know that AI diagnosis (compared to an actual person), has fallen out of favor. ¬†However, since the imaging field is (comparatively) less nuanced, I think it is a safer bet. HOWEVER, we are in the process of splitting the company. ¬†So there will be a managed services division (NewCo) and then there will be IBM. ¬†IBM will be mostly Hardware, OS, and software for the Hardware.¬†  All of this is openly available to the public, so you aren't learning anything new. ¬†The split is supposed to occur this year, and I know there are a lot of hiring freezes in place. ¬†I believe Watson falls under ""Cloud and Cognitive Services (or CCS). ¬†CCS just had a bunch of lay-offs, and I think they are currently under that same hiring freeze.¬†  You would probably be a great candidate. ¬† But what might happen is you'll interview, and it will stay pending FOREVER, because of all the ""uncertainty"" above.  I don't want to dissuade you, but, it might (probably) be a huge waste of your time. ¬†Have you reached out to Kate Naron or Grace Williamson? ¬†I think they are actually both in CCS. ¬†Grace was a year behind us, but I could connect you two if you want. ¬†  Oh, one more thing. ¬†Offering Management in mainframe is so different than what you might see in CCS. ¬†So it would be good to talk to somebody there as well. ¬†Let me know what you think. We can talk more if you want.¬†  Thanks!  Chris",INBOX

I didn‚Äôt see your message until 2 days ago.  I also wanted to draft something for you that wasn‚Äôt just a superficial load of crap.   I would say my biggest challenge was figuring out a system that made the entire first year more manageable.  There were a few times where I either forgot to read something or nearly missed an assignment because I would refer to the syllabus but there would periodically be updates on Moodle (similar to BlackBoard) or you might miss something in class and as a result miss an important piece of information, etc.  I went through a lot of trial and error but eventually what worked for me was the following:  Kept a regular schedule, Mon-Fri, regardless of your classes.  I would get to campus around 7am and stay until about 3:30 or 4.  I would try to do very little work on the weekends, unless there was a big project (which was unavoidable at times). The regular schedule kept me honest and it helped to keep the separation between school and the rest of my life. This will have to be modified for night classes obviously (just a longer day).  Printed out all of my syllabi and kept separate folders and notebooks (for notes) for each course.  I kept a separate planner for assignments and went in and filled everything in for the entire semester, updating as needed.  This was huge because it allowed me to see big picture the work load rather than just on my phone or an online calendar.  I also tried to limit computer use in class and take hand notes (which has been proven to increase memory and retention) unless of course I was in a stats class or quantitative class.  Financial Accounting was the single worst experience of my life.  I would take full advantage of the open office hours.  If you aren‚Äôt 100% sure on anything in the class it will come back to crush you on the mid-term and final.  I didn‚Äôt do that and almost failed, it was by far and away my worst class. Everything builds on top of everything else so it‚Äôs really crucial that you understand everything.  The same goes for Managerial Accounting.  That class was actually really fun though, but just as difficult.  You will have to watch the lectures again every class, you can watch them at 1.5x speed and still follow along.  You don‚Äôt realize it, but Dr. Mitchell is actually teaching you the entire capital assets pricing method but breaking it up into its constituent parts.  She‚Äôs kind of ‚ÄúIncepting‚Äù you if that makes sense.  It was mind-blowing.  Everything you do in that class is a crescendo, build-up for the big finish (beat drop).   I tried to take some trips while I was in the first year but that was tough.  Eventually I made a rule, if I can‚Äôt go without my computer then I don‚Äôt go.  I ended up not going on any more trips after I instituted that rule.  It did cut down on social activities, but my GPA remained high.  You‚Äôll have to find a system that works for you.  I would take advantage of as many Career resources as possible.  I went to most if not all of the corporate presentations.  It‚Äôs a great opportunity for you to ask questions and connect with people on LinkedIn.  This also includes mock interviews and bringing specific internship postings to your counselor so they can provide you guided and specific advice for plans of attack.  The most rewarding part of the first year was probably just surviving.  Getting through that first semester really gives you the confidence to continue pushing hard in that second semester.  I did volunteer with CYC (Consult Your Community) which was a pretty good opportunity.  I wouldn‚Äôt say it was that rewarding because the company we were assigned really didn‚Äôt have their stuff together, so it was kind of a letdown.  I‚Äôm doing it again this semester, they tell me that our previous experience was very atypical and they‚Äôve never had anything like that before.   Let me now if you have any other questions based off of this.  I‚Äôm here to help.  Thanks!   Chris",INBOX

That would be wholly a Watson and/or Blockchain initiative. So, I‚Äôm Mainframe. And mainframe application development. I would say the extent of my technical experience was mostly (light!) programming. Pretty decent in R, okay in Python, okay in HTML. But the product development classes in the MBA program really helped. I would say, I have to search for something technical almost everyday. Mostly because there are so many acronyms, systems, subsystems, etc. Even our application developers, for my product, were stumped on a recent Java question. So, if it‚Äôs not in your area of expertise you‚Äôre basically blind. I think the willingness to learn, the curiosity,and being comfortable with not knowing the answers but rather searching is definitely a thing they look for. ",INBOX

Well, I guess it really depends on where you are looking to go. They way I understand it, the typical route is you interview and then they‚Äôll put you in the business unit with the most need. So, for the few of us, we knew before we interviewed. But that‚Äôs actually atypical. And they‚Äôll talk about the role all very textbook.  Like, when you come in you might only do Go-To-Market, Market/Competetive Analysis, Finance/Legal, etc. It‚Äôs really diverse, which is cool. In my case, I was handed a lagging product and it pretty much encompasses everything. I was thrown to the wolves so to speak. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it, it‚Äôs been challenging to say the least.   I would maybe ask where they needs are right now for Offering Managers. Hybrid Cloud is a big thing, especially with the Red Hat acquisition. But asking about the companies strategic imperatives and how that impacts Offering Management might be good place to start. Maybe inquire about what they look for in an OM. And also ask about the importance of technical aptitude. It might differ depending on the business unit. For us, it‚Äôs super important to understand it. Otherwise it‚Äôs pointless to even try and be an OM, haha! Let me know where I can fill in the gaps if this was lacking!  Thanks, Chris ",INBOX

This is such great information! So, if you'd like to chat more I would love it. I forgot to mention to you too, look into Medium.com or some other blogging platform. I've begun writing on there and have another article in the works. It's a great way to build some credibility and set yourself apart from the rest. I actually had a colleague reach out and ask if he could use a recent three part article series in one of his leadership courses! So, it really does work. I could share with you the project that I am working on because it might give you some ideas.¬†¬†  One final thought, I think stick with one language first and get really good at that. The syntax of the other languages are so close that you will pick them up very easy. For instance R and Python are quite similar as well as JSON. I can usually muddle my way through. Also, take a look at mock dev interviews on youtube.

People have so many choices in this era. Young people like to choose web or mobile development which can offer a higher salary. We can easily say the Internet industry can provide more job opportunities than COBOL positions, COBOL applications¬†are more for the existing established shops, though their biz may grow and increase application needs for COBOL, new shops may not choose COBOL as there are so many alternatives.¬†  When it comes to recruitment, enterprises won't pay higher salary just because the talent pool is limited, the application development is to support biz need, salary will be based on biz value of the output, rather than the rareness of the skillset.¬†  Unit cost of CPU are getting cheaper, companies that can afford to run COBOL, usually have less concern on real money expense on hardware. The migration of COBOL to other languages is more costly and risky.¬†  As decision makers, we have to consider not only the functions and cost of one¬†technology, but the sustainability¬†of the people who run it in behind as well. Big market like the US or CHINA still have big pool of COBOL developer, and there are specialized schools training COBOL, other small market won't have a chance to sustain when no people willing to work with COBOL.¬†  COBOL will still last for decades as there are so many mission-critical applications running on it with great complexity, I just don't have confidence that it can attract next generation to work with it.",INBOX

More specifically, I was hoping to learn more about what I should be focusing on, in the short-term, so that I may gain the necessary experience/education to transition into this career field.  I have done some basic research and it looks like the CAPM is my best bet to gain the necessary (initial) education and certification. However, I'd defer to you for a more seasoned perspective.

I am a personal trainer and co-owner of Apex Personal Training Studio in Cary NC. I came across your profile and I see you have a background in the fitness industry.  If you are currently, or have ever considered personal training as an independent contractor,  I feel we offer a great opportunity for you.  We are a well established and privately owned personal training studio in the Cary/Apex area.  We have a private studio setting with adequate equipment for most training programs. We offer reasonable, per session, rental rates so this is perfect for both trainers with an established client base and trainers who are building a client base. We also provide bottled water, towel service, and office space for consultations for no extra charge. This is a perfect opportunity for trainers who are tired of gyms taking huge chunks of their revenue. This is also great for trainers who do not wish to haul equipment around to your clients homes. This is a central location where you may train your entire client base with all necessary equipment at your disposal. Our location is convenient to Cary, Apex, Morrisville, Holly Springs and Southwest Raleigh. If this seems like an opportunity that would interest you, or someone you know, please contact me. You may reach me via my LinkedIn inbox or 919-724-0352. Thanks.",INBOX

I see that you are back at the old Impact facility; I hope 02 is treating everybody kindly.  I couldn‚Äôt help but think about you the other day.  Let me tell you why though‚Ä¶    I was at Dick‚Äôs Sporting Good‚Äôs a couple weeks ago and I overheard a mother and her children speaking with a shoe salesman.  The daughter had previously purchased a pair of shoes at Dick‚Äôs and she was complaining of discomfort/obvious overuse injury in her lower legs.  I didn‚Äôt hear all the details, however I did hear the salesman retort that the ‚Äúlower priced shoes are often of lower quality‚Äù and you ‚Äúget what you pay for.‚Äù  First of all I immediately thought that was asinine, secondly I thought that‚Äôs not the case at all.  There are some fine shoes out there for reasonable prices, it‚Äôs all dependent on a myriad of factors: leg length discrepancies, running and walking gait, stride length, running technique, to name a few.  If the mother and daughter knew about all of these factors they could have saved a lot of money and would have wasted considerably less time!    So, while the salesman was in the back I approached the mother and informed her of what she was missing.  I directed her to the reputable running shoe outfitters in the triangle area and told her good luck!  However, this happenchance meeting got me thinking.  Are there other parents out there with children participating in sports that haven‚Äôt a clue about things such as this?  For instance; what‚Äôs the best running shoe for my child, or what kind of clothing is the best for my child‚Äôs sport, or how do I ensure that my child can prevent injury from occurring in the first place?!    These are all common sense ideals in my world, but people don‚Äôt even think to consider these items because they don‚Äôt exist outside of the sports and performance world!  So I thought of you!  I thought who can help me reach my intended audience?  Well, you of course.  I‚Äôd like to propose some sort of public presentation format at local PTA meetings so that we can educate parents on sports-for themselves and their children.  I think it‚Äôs a shame that parents are being misinformed, being treated improperly and aren‚Äôt getting the answers to their questions.  Part of this is because parents either don‚Äôt know these questions exist or they don‚Äôt know the right questions to ask.  I want that to change though.  I encounter a great deal of preventable injury in my job.  I think that we could really educate some parents and prevent injury for themselves and their children.    I‚Äôd love to talk with you more about this in person, maybe we can set something up and bounce ideas off of each other.  I hope to hear from you soon!    Best regards,    Chris Hoina",INBOX

What are you passionate about?

Franchising is a very diverse industry today, there are brands for almost everyone. Let our team find the right one for you. We are ready to work and at no charge.   If you are interested in exploring start-up, resale or existing business diversification strategies using franchising as the vehicle for success, simply send me your contact information or preferably set an appointment on my calendar below.  -Jessica  Here is my calendar with the link: https://my.timetrade.com/book/4ZCW6",ARCHIVE
